We will use the final version of Activity 1 as the starting place for Activity 2

The first introduction is to a small format change that is not necessary for stand alone code,
but highly useful for using the script with other programs.

General layout of code in Python:
	import modules
	
	define functions
	
	define startup/global variables
	
	main loop of code

Take Activity#1 file, Save as ...   2_HeadsOrTails_Sequel.py

Using the sequel file: at the bottom of the file, just before the print line, add:
	if __name__ == "__main__":
		print(HorT())

Then add a tab in front of the print statement.

The line we added checks to see if the first code run was this file or another. If it was this file,
it will run the indented code. If not, the indented code will not be executed.

Click F5 to find out.

Next, lets change the main loop. Delete the print line.

This time we want to pseudo code for the following:
* flip coin multiple times based on user input
* display the results

Pseudocode:
define a single flip and return results

ask user for number of flips
start defined (by number of flips) loop
  have we reached the number of flips?
  get result of single flip
  if heads, add 1 to heads count
  if tails, add 1 to tails count
  end loop
print out number of heads and tails

Here is my code:

	# 2_HeadsOrTails_Sequel.py
	# by A.Colwell(July 2017)
	# Professional Learning Session
	# Prints results of random chosen heads or tails

	# Modules
	import random

	# Functions
	def HorT():
		result = random.choice(['heads','tails'])
		return result

	# Initial variables
	headsCount = 0
	tailsCount = 0

	if __name__ == "__main__":
		numOfFlips = input('Enter number of coin flips:')
		intFlips = int(numOfFlips)
		for flip in range(0,intFlips):
			singleFlip = HorT()
			if singleFlip == 'heads':
				headsCount = headsCount + 1
			else:
				tailsCount = tailsCount + 1

		print('Number of heads:',headsCount)
		print('Number of tails:',tailsCount)

The code now displays the results of the number of flips.

However, the script could be useful in math class, but perhaps in a different way.
So, lets convert our main loop to a function.
Under the Functions section, we are going to add a new function.
In this function, we are going to accept the number of flips (an argument) into a variable (parameter) in the function.
