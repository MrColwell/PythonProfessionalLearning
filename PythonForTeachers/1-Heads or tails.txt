Activity #1

pseudocode (Version A)
import random module (how to find Python info with Google - python 3 random choice)
choose one of two answers (heads or tails)
print result to screen

in python shell
	1. import random

	2. result = random.choice(['heads','tails'])

	3. print(result)

To make another choice, we do not need to import again, unless shell has restarted.
We would need to type in lines 2 and 3.

So, we make a script (short bit of code that python can run through the interpreter) and we save to a file

As a python file 

	import random
	result = random.choice(['heads','tails'])
	print(result)

Press f5, to save and run the module.

Next, make sure we document the file
At the very top, add file name, author, date, and what the code does after the hash tag.

	# 1_HeadsOrTails.py
	# by A.Colwell(July 2017)
	# Professional Learning Session
	# Prints results of random chosen heads or tails

Lastly, we are going to make this code useful for the future.
Results will be returned by a function, so that we can make it useful in other programs.
Here is the complete code:
	# 1_HeadsOrTails.py
	# by A.Colwell(July 2017)
	# Professional Learning Session
	# Prints results of random chosen heads or tails

	import random

	def HorT():
		result = random.choice(['heads','tails'])
		return result

	print(HorT())
